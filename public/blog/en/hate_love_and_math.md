# Mathematical proof that hate is stronger than love

It has been shown mathematically that hate outperforms love.

Why?

Social media recommendation systems are optimised to keep users on the platform as long as possible, so the AI has learned that hate, extremism, or content that reinforces our existing views is the best way to keep people engaged.

Twitter (I will never call it X) has shown that false content is 6 times more likely to get interactions.

So yes, a statistical model has converged on a system that recommends more hate than love—so sadly I take it that hate is more powerful than love. At least in the short term, in terms of immediate, subconscious engagement. But maybe if we don't give in to the dark side of our media and the murky part of our primitive nature, and we push back with the best weapon we have—self-reflection, pausing to check if we're wrong, keeping an open mind—then we can build a better future, and hate will be just a short-term spike while love is the steady, unstoppable force humanity deserves.
