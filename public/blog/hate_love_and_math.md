# Mathematical proof that hate is stronger than love

It has been mathematically proven that hate overcomes love.

Why?

Social media recommender systems are optimized to keep the user the most time in the platform, so, this AI has learned that hate, extremist or ideas that reinforces our opinions are the best option to keep people inside the platform.

Twitter (i'll never call it X), has demostrated that the fake content is 6 times more likely to have interactions.

So, yes, a statistical model has converged into a system that recommends more hate than love, so sadly, I assume, that hate is more powerfull than love. At least, at in short term, since we are talking in terms of the inmediate interactions, subconscius, but, maybe, if we don't succumb to the darkest side of our mids, to the shady part of our primitive nature and we rebel ourselves with the biggest weapon we have against this, that is self-seflexion, stop and verify if we are wrong, have open mids, maybe then, we can build a better future, and then, hate will just be a spike in a short term, but love will be the big non-stoping force with momentum that human kind deserves.
