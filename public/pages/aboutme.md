Heya! I am **Jaume Ivars Grimalt**, thanks for your interest on me :)

I am a young entrepreneur that loves to learn and make new projects, I've studied Computer Science at UPV in Valencia and a Master's about AI.

I am curently looking for moving abroad, this city has became a little small for my ambitions now!

&nbsp;

## But why Computer Science?

Basically, because I am a nerdy courious boi.

Since I was a kid, I've always wanted to build new things, that's why I started playing with Scratch and Arduino. I loved Physics, Math and Computer Science classes at High School.
So, I wondered which was the option that let me jump to any other branch of the human knowleadge, and that was Computer Science. Do you know any science that doesn't require calculus, information management or statistics?

Physics? -> The first photo of a black hole was made using Generative AI models with petabytes of data.

Bilogy? -> The revolution of pharmaceutical industry is leaded by AlphaFold models that help discovering new drugs.

Math? -> AI models discovered already some new algorithms that humans didn't know

All the science works with information systems, data bases, or statistical models, even Business, Phylosophy, History, Music, Art.

That's why I wanted to study this. Because I want to learn about everything. In fact, you can checkout my Learning Notes and you'll see what I know about and also learn about my favourite topics! (Checkout the main page)

## About My Approach

I'm naturally drawn to understanding *why* things work, not just *how*.

In high school, when we learned integrals, I became fascinated with extending the concept to volumetric integrals and even hypervolumes in 4D space—not because it was required, but because I needed to see the pattern.

I tend to question assumptions and rebuild solutions from the ground up. Sometimes this means finding unconventional paths to the same answer. I value environments that reward creative problem-solving over rigid adherence to prescribed methods.

I'm most motivated when exploring unknown territory. My bookshelf reflects this: books and papers about machine learning principles, sttistics, quantum mechanics, numerical methods, differential equations, philosophy, business. I learn what I need when I need it, often teaching myself rather than waiting for formal instruction.

## Where you come from?

I'm from a little town called Gata de Gorgos, from Alicante, 100km from where I live now. When I was 17 I moved to Valencia with some roomates to study my bachelor's and master's. Since then I've been living by myself here. It's a very nice city excepting the summer. I hate hot humidity.

## What are your hobbies?

I curently I like to go to the gym and do calisthenics, watch nive and lovely series like The Owl House, read about phylosophy, sci-fi novels such as Dune or read papers and learn about the brand new science in Deep Learning. You can checkout my notes on Deep Learning [here](/learning_notes)
I used to play chess and draw, but because of my projects I needed more time for that, when I have some more free time I'll rescue these lovely hobbies. Also, If you are near Valencia and want to train with me I'll be very glad to make new gym friends!

&nbsp;

## What is your favourite videogame?

I do really LOVE some videogames. I am big fan of Portal 2, New Super Mario Bross Wii, New Super Mario Bros DS, Mario Kart Wii and obviously Minecraft. Also, my first business was a Minecraft server, and I started larning Java in my 15 years to code my own plugins and videogames to play with my friends!

&nbsp;

## Do you preffer city or town?

I do really love my old friends and my parents, but I admit I like more the city because of the opportunities and the new people I've meet here. Valencia is a really nice city to life. The only bad thing is the high rent.

&nbsp;

## What is your wildest wish?

My wildest wish for my life is being trully free. By freedom I mean: freedom to learn whatever I want whenever I want, build big things and have the knowleadge to do so, when a problem comes out, knowing how to search for a solution, not having fear of anything or anyone. True freedom is a very hard thing, it's the hability of doing everything and that needs a very high discipline, because when you can do everything but you only guide yourself by your animal instinct (fame, sex, power...) you are not free. True good choices comes from wild dreams and aspirations, with the finality to give something to the humanity. The sense of life is to give, we only can wish for the freedom of what and how give something to others.

So yeah, my wildest dream is to be free to do "whatever" I "want" for humanity. We are alone here. I am alone. You are alone. Biology tells us that our porpuse is to socialise, to be usefull, there is no point on fighting that, so with the little possibilities our biology lets us to choose, I choose being able to choose every opion.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

## What is your biggest fear?

Becoming a boring adult and forget who I really am: Someone that loves to build stuff, learn lots of new things and play with my knowleadge.
